# Paeonia

Paeonia is a computer assisted music composition software. It draws a lot of inspiration from Opusmodus but is designed from the ground up to not make you want to jam a fork in your eye. It is also designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook. Which makes more sense then you would initially think actually.

# Basic Use

Here is how to install and use it Google Collab.

It relies on fluidsynth for preview and lilypond for score rendering. So run these commands first.

```
!apt install fluidsynth
!apt install lilypond
```
