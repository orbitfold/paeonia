# Paeonia

Paeonia is a computer assisted music composition software.

It has two dependencies - lilypond and fluidsynth. First one for notation rendering and the other one for playback. On a Mac you can install them with the following commands (if you have homebrew):

```
brew cask install lilypond
brew cask install fluidsynth
```
