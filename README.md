# Paeonia

Paeonia is a computer assisted music composition software. It draws a lot of inspiration from Opusmodus but is designed from the ground up to not make you want to jam a fork in your eye. It is also designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook. Which makes more sense then you would think actually.

It has two dependencies - lilypond and fluidsynth. First one for notation rendering and the other one for playback. On a Mac you can install them with the following commands (if you have homebrew):

```
brew cask install lilypond
brew cask install fluidsynth
```
